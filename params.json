{"name":"Salty","body":"### Installation\r\n\r\nJust\r\n\r\n`$ gem install salty`\r\n\r\nand you're good.\r\n\r\nIf you want, you can also just\r\n\r\n`$ wget https://raw.github.com/alecbenzer/salty/master/lib/salty.rb`\r\n\r\nand get the file locally. It's less than 1KB.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n    require 'salty'  # you may need to do './salty' if you used wget\r\n\r\n    password = Salty.hash('mypassword') # iterative salted SHA512 hash\r\n\r\n    if Salty.check('mypassword',password)\r\n      puts \"You're logged in!\"\r\n    else\r\n      puts \"Wrong password\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\nA salt is generated and embeded in the output from `Salty.hash`. `Salty.check` will then extract this salt, so there is no need to handle the salt yourself.\r\n\r\nObviously, the order of arguments to `Salty.check` is important. The plain-text data must come first, followed by the previously-hashed data.\r\n\r\nSee more on [github](https://github.com/alecbenzer/salty) and check out this [blog post](http://alecbenzer.com/salty-hashing)","tagline":"salted hashing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
